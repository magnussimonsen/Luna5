# Toâ€‘Do

## UI and Navigation
- Clean up the Settings side panel; remove unused selectors.
- Remove the Settings option from the File menu (settings now lives in the side panel).

## Panels and Help
- Add a "Planned / Work in Progress" label to unfinished side panels: Table of Contents, Help, Variables.
- Add a list of shipped Python modules to the Help side panel and to About (File menu).

## Text Cells
- Add a placeholder to text cells (e.g., "This is a simple editable div. A proper text editor is in development").

## Major Projects
- Standardize and organize CSS custom properties (`var(--*)`): naming, grouping, and file structure.

## Idea for stucturing the help library
In help sidebar, add options to load help notebooks on spesific subjects. For example: Load help notebook Plotting in python, Load help notebook Statistics in python and so on.
