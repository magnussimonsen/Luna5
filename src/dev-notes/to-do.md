# Toâ€‘Do


## Font size slider
Edit cell container such that the hight (min) is reactive to the selected cell type font size.

Add deafult font size in settings for python code settings side panel and text cell settings side panel, and initialize the deault font size per cell type in font size store. 




## UI and Navigation
- Remove the Settings option from the File menu (settings now lives in the side panel).


## Major Projects
- Standardize and organize CSS custom properties (`var(--*)`): naming, grouping, and file structure.

## Idea for stucturing the help library
In help sidebar, add options to load help notebooks on spesific subjects. For example: Load help notebook Plotting in python, Load help notebook Statistics in python and so on.
