// ARCHIVED: Monaco editor pooling implementation
// This file is kept for reference only. The active implementation uses
// per-cell Monaco instances and a lightweight shim is provided in
// `editorPool.ts` to avoid breaking imports during the migration.

// Original editor pool implementation (archived) retained below for
// historical/reference purposes. Do not import this file directly; use
// `editorPool.ts` which may export shims.

/*
<archived content omitted in this archived file to keep the repo small in
this patch. The full implementation has been kept in the previous file and
is available in git history.>
