    This panel will host the Flashcards feature. The functionality and interface will be designed to
    match the existing Notebooks structure. Instead of a list of notebooks, it will display a list
    of flashcard decks. Each deck will contain flashcards that users can review and manage.
    <br /><br />
    The flashcards will support spaced repetition, allowing users to optimize their learning
    process. Users will be able to create, edit, and organize flashcards within decks.
    <br /><br />
    Additional features may include tagging flashcards and tracking progress.
